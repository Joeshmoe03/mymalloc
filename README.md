Testing: do "make" and run "./myio". You will see a writefile0.txt with a write test result. readfile0.txt and readfile1.txt are dependencies for this test. If there are any additional debugging tests you wish to run, you may choose to further uncomment certain lines in test.c, though I strongly advise using writefile0.txt as a basis for determining that it works.
